##Integrated Optical Mapping Scaffolding
This workflow is used to do genome assembly scaffolding using assembly sequences and optical consensus maps

Inputs:

De novo assembly contigs of PacBio reads using Falcon and PBcR, respectively

optical consensus maps from de novo assembly of optical mapping molecules data

Usage:

Please read the file run.sh in this directory. The file run.sh describes how to run each step
