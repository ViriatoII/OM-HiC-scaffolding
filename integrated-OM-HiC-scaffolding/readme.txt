Integrated Optical-Mapping and Dovetail-HiC Scaffolding

This scaffolding workflow mainly contains steps:
1) integrated optical mapping scaffolding. When determing misassembled contigs, the HiRise findings of misassemblies were also used.
2) Dovetail HiC scaffolding using the tool HiRise
3) interative optical mapping scaffolding to re-scaffold those false misassembled region found by HiRise
