##OM-HiC-scaffolding 
Here the scripts are used in the manuscript "Improving and correcting the contiguity of long-read genome assemblies of three plant species using optical mapping and chromatin conformation capture data"

#Description
These scripts are used to do genome assembly scaffolding in three ways:

1)  scaffolding using optical consensus maps and PacBio read assembly contigs from Falcon and PBcR

2)  scaffolding using Dovetail Hi-C reads and PacBio read assembly contigs from Falcon and PBcR

3)  scaffolding using optical consensus maps, Dovetail Hi-C reads and PacBio read assembly contigs from Falcon and PBcR


#System requirements
Perl(version >5.10); Bioperl 

IrysSolver, RefAligner from BioNano Genomics 

HiRise (https://github.com/DovetailGenomics/HiRise_July2015_GR)

#Usage
Please read the "readme.txt" in each scaffolding worflow
