##OM-HiC-scaffolding 
Here the scripts are used in the manuscript "mproving and correcting the contiguity of long-read genome assemblies of three plant species using optical mapping and chromatin capture data"

#introduction
These scripts are used to do genome assembly scaffolding in three diffent inputs as below:
1)  optical consensus maps and PacBio read assembly contigs from Falcon and PBcR
2)  Dovetail Hi-C reads and PacBio read assembly contigs from Falcon and PBcR
3)  optical consensus maps, Dovetail Hi-C reads and PacBio read assembly contigs from Falcon and PBcR

#requirements
Perl(version >5.10)

Bioperl 

IrysSolver, RefAligner from BioNano Genomics 

HiRise (https://github.com/DovetailGenomics/HiRise_July2015_GR)

#usage
Please read the "readme.txt" in each scaffolding worflow
